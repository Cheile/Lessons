# Meet-Up #5 Agenda:

**Objective**: Create an official circuit diagram of your project

## 1. Learning
**What is a circuit diagram**

[From Wikipedia: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_diagram)
*A circuit diagram (electrical diagram, elementary diagram, electronic schematic) is a graphical representation of an electrical circuit. A pictorial circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a schematic diagram shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. *

**How do you create a circuit diagram?**

You can use the Tinkercad Arduino simulator to build your circuit and convert it into a diagram.
